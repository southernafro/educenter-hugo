## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Homeschoolers Hub was started in preparation for our children. We wanted to create a hub of resources for them and for parents like us to refer to. My fiance was homeschooled and loved it. I, on the other hand, went through the conventional private schooling system. I too enjoyed that. When deciding which approach we would take for our children, it was not an easy decision. Our outcomes are fairly similar. That is why we decided to dig into the research data to see what it says.

Fortunately, we have a lot of friends who are educators. Both of us have also served on various boards and groups within education. We have also been involved in the local homeschooling community for a while now. It has provided us with tremendous insight into the personal choices and drivers of said choices for various parents.

Welcome to our journey!
