Are you looking for a book about homeschooling? When it comes to homeschooling unless you are a professional teacher, any homeschooling situation is likely to take you out of your comfort zone.

However, no one is asking you to be the world’s greatest teacher. All you have to do is make sure your children feel engaged for short periods and try not to lose your patience. Very few parents will be prepared for this, and for most of them, it’s been decades since they were last in a classroom.

Some are straight-up homeschooling bibles, some are manifestos on the benefits of learning from home, ways to best impart information, and details on how a day’s structure might look. All of them offer support to parents who might feel lost or frustrated. From a poetry anthology to a guide to teaching on a small budget

### The Unschooling Handbook: How to Use the Whole World

Written in a conversational, salon-style manner, The Unschooling Handbook is liberally peppered with anecdotes and practical advice from unschoolers, identified by their first names and home states. The book also includes resources such as one teenager's sample "transcript," a typical weekly log of a third-grader's activities, and helpful lists of magazines, online mailing lists, Web sites, and catalogs.

Unschooling, is a homeschooling method based on the belief that kids learn best when allowed to pursue their natural curiosities and interests, is practiced by 10 to 15 percent of the estimated 1.5 million homeschoolers in the United States. There is no curriculum or master plan for allowing children to decide when what, and how they will learn, but veteran homeschooler Mary Griffith comes as close as you can get in this slim manual.

### My Family and Other Animals – Gerald Durrell

In this book, we note that Gerald Durrell grew up to become a world-famous zoo collector and later zookeeper, bestselling author, and conservationist, and credits his time on Corfu with providing the foundation. It’s a great example of where passion-led learning can lead. Though this is an autobiography that doesn’t mention homeschooling at all, Gerald Durrell’s childhood provides the perfect example of what a relaxed upbringing, unschooling in many ways, can achieve.

He gets to roam Corfu freely, collecting and studying animals and spending plenty of time with interesting people. His tutor has to relate everything back to animals to get him to learn anything, and the maths and French he is forced to do periodically when the family is worried that he is becoming too wild.

### Teach Your Own – John Holt & Pat Farenga

In this book John Holt was one of the pioneers of the modern homeschooling movement, and his work is still popular. When you read this book you will realise why and his timeless wisdom. Holt was a strong advocate of respecting children and supporting them in using their natural initiative and curiosity in learning. Teach Your Own covers why you should homeschool, how you should do it, and addresses the practicalities and worries about doing so very convincingly.

Rather than proposing that parents turn their homes into miniature schools, Holt and Farenga demonstrate how ordinary parents can help children grow as social, active learners.

Today more than one and a half million children are being taught at home by their own parents. In this expanded edition of the book that helped launch the whole movement. Chapters on living with children, "serious play," children and work, and learning difficulties will fascinate and encourage parents and help them enjoy each "homeschool" day.

### Curious Unschoolers: Stories of an Unschooling Family- Sue Elvis

Sue says: "…imagine us sitting around your kitchen table, mugs in our hands, chatting about unschooling together. I'm going to share my family and our experiences. We'll ponder ideas and thoughts. Our conversation will go deep and wide. It'll be honest and real. And it'll be flavoured with love and gentleness." Every story has pertinent questions to get you thinking it’s not ‘do it like this’ but almost like the Socratic dialogue in a book.

In this wonderful book, Sue Elvis talks about unschooling in an honest, intimate, and personal way, using stories from her many years of radical unschooling to illustrate points, showing how she’s overcome common problems. Even if you’re not a radical unschooler, you’ll get a lot of fantastic homeschooling advice and ideas from Curious Unschoolers.

It boils down to unconditional love, and everyone benefits from that. Curious Unschoolers will make you feel excited about the possibilities. When you get to the last page, perhaps you’ll feel encouraged to set out on an unschooling adventure of your own.

### The Well-Trained Mind – Susan Wise Bauer & Jessie Wise

This book is totally inspiring and also a little intimidating, but it can definitely work as a resource bible. It outlines a very rigorous and comprehensive classical education program from preschool to the end of high school. The Well-Trained Mind will instruct you, step by step, on how to give your child an academically rigorous, comprehensive education from preschool through high school.

Veteran home educators Susan Wise Bauer and Jessie Wise outline the classical pattern of education called the trivium, which organizes learning around the maturing capacity of the child’s mind and comprises three stages: the elementary school “grammar stage,” when the building blocks of information are absorbed through memorization and rules; the middle school “logic stage,” in which the student begins to think more analytically; and the high-school “rhetoric stage,” where the student learns to write and speak with force and originality.

## Buyer’s Guide

### What are the advantages of homeschooling?

* Homeschooling offers more specialized educational attention for special needs children. Unlike most public schools that use the same teaching methods for all children.

* When it comes to homeschooling you find that children progress faster and learn faster than in a public school setting.

* When you choose to homeschool, you won’t have to worry about tuition fees, transport, food, and stationery costs. So you may think that homeschooling is less expensive when compared to public schools. In terms of the operational costs.

* Homeschool can save time for both you and your kid since you won’t have to transport your kids to and from school every day. You also don’t have to worry about making them late for school and so forth.

* Schooling at home may promote a closer familial relationship. You’ll find that many parents find that they enjoy spending extra time with their kids in homeschool.

* Well, most people who undertake to homeschool believe that home is the safest, most secure environment in which a child can learn. At home, a child does not have to deal with peer pressure or with fitting-in with the popular cliques. A child can just “be.” This gives the child the opportunity to focus on the lessons being taught and on the educational expectations required of him or her.

### What are the disadvantages of homeschooling?

* When you choose to educate your child at home, you have to put your career goals or ambitions aside and shift your focus to teaching the child. Unless of course, you hire someone to do it for you.

* Public Schooling education will expose your child, although minimally, to a variety of topics. In homeschooling, parents can choose to limit or even eliminate the subject from their curriculum, leaving the child with no knowledge of it. Also, it is not possible for a parent to teach complex topics in subjects such as math, physics, chemistry, or calculus unless they are experts. This limits the amount of information that a child gets through homeschooling.

* Public schools are more structured and have a better-planned curriculum than home-schools. The school’s system has tried and tested teaching methodologies, credible sources of information, and standardized assessments. They even select some of the best teachers to give your child the best education. Something which some parents may fail to do.

* When a child is educated at home, he has little interaction with other kids of his age. Even if he does, he does not get to experience the same things as school-going children. They do not get to experience school or class trips and projects or lunch with friends.

### What are the types of homeschooling?

#### Traditional Homeschooling

Traditional homeschooling is vitally doing school at home with the use of methods that are similar to those you find in public or private schools. Since most parents are familiar with this mode of education you will find that new parents in terms of homeschooling often buy textbooks and all learning material which you may find in a regular classroom. Although many families migrate away from this style as they gain more confidence in homeschooling.

#### Roadschooling

With this type of homeschooling, you will find that most of the homeschoolers become able to use the attractions they see as a means for educational enhancement in their studies. Besides that, it surely is a great way to study as it is not as boring as being stuck at home in your room with a textbook. This hands-on, experiential way of learning appeals to many families and accounts for the growth of road schooling nationwide.

#### Worldschooling

Worldschooling is an educational movement that recognizes that a student can receive no greater education than by experiencing and interacting with the world around them. It’s also important to keep in mind the myriad of ways to incorporate world culture in your child’s education. For families able to make it work, this often involves traveling together and using the journeys to enhance their kid’s education.

#### Unschooling

With this type of homeschooling, the ball is in the learner’s hands. This type mostly involves nurturing a child’s natural curiosity, without placing artificial time constraints on them such as the introduction of certain subjects at certain ages, or without structuring their day in the same way a classroom setting might.

#### Classic Homeschooling

With the classic approach of homeschooling, the end goal is to allow and to teach kids to think for themselves and not rely on anyone else. Using the trivium model, children move through three main stages of learning: concrete learning which is the grammar stage, then they go on to critical learning which is the logic stage, and abstract learning the rhetoric stage.

### What are the stages of Classic Homeschooling?

**The Grammar Stage** - For homeschoolers, this boils down to making sure a student has core knowledge of math, language arts, science, and social studies.

**The Logic Stage** – Also known as the dialectic stage is whereby a student has reached fifth grade, concrete thinking gives way to more analytical reasoning.

**The Rhetoric Stage** – Classically homeschooled high schoolers will focus heavily on the medium of communication. They will learn about essay writing, public speaking, accounting, engineering, politics, and economics.

In conclusion, there is more to homeschooling than people actually notice and the above books give you a deeper insight into what you need to know to give your child the best form of education possible.
