Private schooling in California is mainly an urban phenomenon, and these schools are often seen as a way of escaping the hardships of public schools. In California, a private school can be reimbursed up to $8,365, depending on your income bracket.

However, not every private school is a haven with spotless classrooms and great teacher-student ratios. A recent study has shown that students at Catholic and religiously affiliated institutions in the state significantly underperform in math and reading when compared to their peers at other private schools.

## Entry Requirements

In order for a private school to qualify as state-funded, they must:

Operate primarily in the public schools;

Have a daily average student enrollment of at least 200; and

Have an average daily attendance of at least 90 percent.

A private school is allowed a maximum class size of 20 students. There are some exceptions to this rule: One-fifth of all students in certain programs can be taught in a class of fewer than 20 pupils.

## California Department of education private schools

About one-fifth of all students in the state are educated in private schools

California has a total of 700,000 students in private schools, the majority of which are Catholic and religiously affiliated. The largest numbers of students are enrolled at eight independent (unorganized) schools, including the Loyola Marymount University and Santa Clara University private universities, and California's two most accomplished private primary and secondary schools. About one-fifth of all students in the state are educated in private schools.

The California Department of Education administers the K-12 school program and organizes the state's standardized testing program in order to provide accurate, impartial information about California students' educational performance and progress toward the State's academic standards. The Department also oversees private schools, all of which must be licensed by the California Department of Education if they wish to accept state-subsidized students.
