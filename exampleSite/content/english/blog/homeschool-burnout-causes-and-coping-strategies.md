Are you looking at the good, the bad and the ugly about homeschooling? It's an educational philosophy that may differ from the usual, but more and more people across the globe are taking a keen interest in it. There are many benefits to homeschooling, but there are some downsides as well, and to make an informed decision it helps to know what you are up against and how to handle it.

In this article, we take a look at homeschool burnout causes and coping strategies. How do parents and children deal with the hurdles you may face when you decide to homeschool? We will take a look at what causes burnout, how you can avoid it, and also how to deal with it. Let's take a look, shall we?

## What is homeschool burnout?

Looking after children throughout the day can be a tiresome job. It can be taxing on you physically and mentally. Add homeschooling to this, and you are now their teacher in addition to being their caregiver. This in itself, comes with the risk of burnout and fatigue. Homeschool burnout happens when you expend a lot of energy, that you don’t have to spare.

Burnout is exhaustion, both in the mind and in the body. Simply put, you just don’t want to do it anymore and the fulfilment you got from it before isn’t there anymore.

## How do I know I'm experiencing burnout?

If you are new to homeschooling, you probably have several questions, such as how do you know that you are experiencing burnout? There are a couple of things that you should be on the lookout for. Some of the changes are your mood such as being very impatient all of a sudden or crying easily, having mood swings that are unexplainable such as these. You may also find yourself reacting to small issues in an unwarranted way.

You may also be reacting by overeating, or not having any appetite all of a sudden. You may be very cynical all of a sudden, or find that you have just lost the drive to start the day. The other way to tell If all of a sudden you are making irrational decisions. Most of these signs will probably be noticed by others around you.

Another symptom is feeling anxious or depressed to start the day, and the feelings don’t go away. You may also lose motivation and yet still don’t care even if your work is falling behind. Whilst homeschooling is stressful to a certain extent, there comes a time where these above signs appear and are more intense and consistent compared to when you are stressed out about anything else.

You can also tell that you are experiencing burnout, if you find yourself feeling envious of parents who don’t homeschool, or if you have a certain level of bitterness when you think about the responsibility that awaits you.

Some parents say that they experience a feeling of wanting to be left alone even from family. You may also feel like you have failed or just haven’t accomplished enough.

## What causes homeschool burnout?

The thing about homeschooling is that your child's future is tied to how you do it, therefore burnout can be very disruptive. There are certain situations in life that we have no control over and these can be some of the biggest causes of homeschool burnouts. Situations such as having a new baby, or getting an illness may be the cause of lethargy and lack of motivation to do other things such as homeschooling.

You may also find that changing your daily routine or moving from one house to another could cause a lack of motivation. Homeschool burnout can also be caused by a parent having unrealistic expectations of themselves and also of the student. You may also quickly burnout because you are not organized and decide to “see how it goes”.

Another cause for homeschool burnout, Is when you have roo many activities on your plate. the anxiety from this will easily cause burnout. Laziness or pride is another cause of homeschool burnout.

## How can I cope with homeschool burnout?

Now that we have gone through the possible causes for burnout, and what it looks like, let's look at what you can do to cope with it. If the key cause is laziness, or just being unmotivated, then you could keep a journal of successes and record what you have done right, and the progress that you have made. Going back to look at these milestones helps to keep your spirits high.

You could also try switching it up. Create a space that is new and exciting for both you and your child. You could incorporate newer activities that get you going out more, this way you are getting a fresh view. Get out of routine and introduce something new so that you both don’t get tired. There's a fine line between upsetting the system and avoiding routine which can lead to burnout.

You can also set lower expectations. This isn’t about dropping a standard, but more about getting you and your child to enjoy the learning experience rather than be bogged down by anxiety caused by testing.

This may sound a little wacky, but try it before you discard it. Do you know how you may write a letter of complaint to your child's school? Do the same, sending it to yourself. Write a letter to yourself, listing all the issues that “the teacher” has. Seeing your issues on paper can bring a profound sense of clarity.

You could also ask your child what their opinion is of your teaching. For future classes, to avoid burning out again, you could try to train your children to be more independent and self-sufficient so that you get more alone time, and not get too tired too quickly. Adopting homeschooling styles that allow the child to have more freedom, is a great option.

Another coping mechanism is to plan your lessons ahead of time so that you are more organized and avoid running around like a headless chicken.
