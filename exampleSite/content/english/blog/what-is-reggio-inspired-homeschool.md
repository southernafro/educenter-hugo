In these days where homeschooling has become so popular, a lot of parents have begun to consider homeschooling needs. It can be confusing terrain to navigate especially with different homeschooling styles all claiming to be the best in the game.

Are asking yourself what Reggio inspired homeschool is? It is an educational philosophy that believes that children have all they need to learn. This means that you homeschool your child according to these ideals.

This article will look at the Reggio Emilia inspired homeschool. It was developed by an Italian Psychologist, [Louis Malaguzzi](https://www.reggiochildren.it/en/reggio-emilia-approach/loris-malaguzzi/). It is an approach that lets the child's interests and on work, they can do and concepts they can discover with their hands. We will take a deeper and in-depth look at what Reggio inspired homeschool is and what you can expect. Let's dive in, shall we?

## Why should I homeschool my child?

There are various reasons why parents choose to homeschool. This is probably something that you have been hearing a lot about in the past couple of months. Some parents will choose the homeschooling option because it means that you will have more control over what your child learns and how they learn it.

Homeschooling also cuts out the danger of your child catching an outbreak that may be at their school. We’ve seen a lot more of this in 2020, as the coronavirus spread and governments across the world shut down schools to keep children safe.

The other reason for homeschooling is that your child has the freedom to learn at flexible times and to learn subjects better tailored to them, rather than a more general approach. Homeschooling also allows you and your child to dictate the pace, and be more productive. It encourages meaningful and productive learning in an environment the child is comfortable with.

## What is the Reggio Emilia approach?

There are many different homeschooling methods that you can try. One of these is the Reggio Emilia method. This teaching philosophy is based on the things that most interest your child as well as projects they can do to learn the relevant lessons. Developed by an Italian psychologist, this method has been used by parents who want to give their children the freedom to learn by exploring their surroundings.

This approach encourages the child to explore their interests more than stick to a particular curriculum. One of the philosophies that this method is based on, is that children are born with a hundred languages. In simpler terms, they have all they need to learn. The lessons that your child learns from experimenting and exploring their interests, with the parent's guidance, are life lessons.

## What does a Reggio inspired homeschool look like?

As the Reggio Emilia approach encourages the child's interests to be built upon, the environment where the lessons are conducted is important. It is encouraged that the home lets in as much natural light as possible, to create a fresh and light environment. It will be important to make sure that the learning space is comfortable and inviting.

It helps to keep it clean, with everything in its place, and easily accessible, to allow your child's eyes to get caught up and perhaps take interest in a definitive concept or subject. Knowing where things stay and having the security that they know what to expect in the room, helps them be more secure in their decision making, which you are trying to foster.

## How do I teach my child how to handle projects in a Reggio inspired homeschool?

You will need to be available to offer help in the event that they ask for it, but not to impose your school of thought. Since this approach is also project-based, it is important that they come from your child’s interests. Also, show them what your process is when you work on projects. This helps them see how you deal with personal victories, failures, and frustrations.

You can show them this process, by verbalizing your process. Just as you make mistakes, leave room for the same for your child. They need to know that not all projects will turn out in the exact way they envisioned them. These are some of the life lessons that will make them better adults.

## How can I discover my child's interests?

The Reggio inspired homeschool is based largely on your child's interests. But how do you know what these are so that you help the child build up towards those interests? Besides creating an environment that encourages free thinking and clutter-free, you can also open up your child's imagination by going out more often. Take your child on field trips, camping, and so forth. This may spark interest in your child.

## How do I track my child’s progress?

Whilst this is an unconventional way of learning, you will need to have a way of documenting your children progress. This is an important part of the process. Keep a parents journal, this will help you know how your child is fairing and what lessons they are grasping. Both you and your child can look back on the projects worked on.

The progress journal can be a record of accomplishments, questions and projects. It also notes any interests that the child has picked up and what may have sparked those. It can help draw a definitive line for future interests and projects.

## What does the Reggio-inspired curriculum look like?

You can choose how to structure your days. Reggio inspired homeschooling is project-based, but you can also have other subjects such as languages, or math. To make sure that your homeschooling borrows ideas from the Reggio Emilia approach. You need to structure days according to the child's interests and not your own. You may have a few hours set aside for particular subjects but always ensure that your child's interests are top priority.

  
Homeschooling is a worthy consideration, and the [Reggio Emilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia) method is one of the many to think about if you prefer a less structured, more flexible way of homeschooling your child.
