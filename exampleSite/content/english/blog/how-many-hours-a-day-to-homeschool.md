Are you thinking about homeschooling your child? It comes with a number of various factors to review and take into consideration. But perhaps you're not a teacher and perhaps you are also not sure where to start in preparing the right curriculum and lesson plans. Homeschooling the right way, may also see you asking yourself some pertinent questions such as how many hours a day to homeschool?

Structure and consistency are very important for a child. When they are homeschooled, they can get comfortable with their surroundings and may have some trouble distinguishing between playtime and school time. In this article, we take a look at how many hours a day to homeschool your child, where to draw the line, and what is healthy and what isn’t. At the end of the day, you want to make sure that it is beneficial on both ends. Let us dig in.

## What are the top reasons for homeschooling?

There are many reasons why people may choose to teach their children at home. Chief among these is the need to control what your child learns. This may be fuelled by religious beliefs. You may also want to homeschool your child because they have special needs, you may need to travel during the regular school term, or perhaps because of employment for the child (such as child actors).

Some parents also choose to pull their children out of school because they are not

happy with the school system, or perhaps because of bullying which has been the

result of hundreds of child suicides across the world.

## What to consider when deciding on how many hours to homeschool your child?

### How long do schools teach for?

There are various factors that you need to consider when deciding how many hours are enough when it comes to homeschooling your child. It may help to take a leaf from existing school structures. They are put in place and they work, for a reason.

Where you will be homeschooling your child, also has a significant impact on this. Schools around the world have different timetables, and these are partly influenced by weather conditions. Schools in Australia, generally have a 25 week year. It will be helpful to take a closer look at how the schools break down the weeks and the amount of time spent on particular subjects.

Just like schools have recess time, it is important to make sure that your child has some breathing time. Try not to overwhelm your child with long hours of lessons at one go. The moment learning stops being interactive, or fun for the student, the sooner they want it to stop. Then no one wins in such a case.

### Geographical location

This will also determine the regulations of how many hours you can homeschool your child. This is largely due to the fact that the curriculum may differ, as well as the subjects that will be taught. It goes without saying that the more subjects there are, the more hours you will need. At the same time, you do not want to overwhelm the child.

### Your child’s age

The number of hours that you teach your child will also depend on your child's age and what type of lessons they will need. In school, first graders will typically have a differently structured day as compared to the 7th graders.

### The homeschooling program you use

There are many different homeschooling programs around the world. The number of hours that are stipulated for a day’s lesson, maybe a result of the founder's philosophy on how homeschooling should be conducted. However, it is important to remember that homeschooling schedules will look different from one home to another.

### How many days will you be homeschooling?

The number of hours that you put into homeschooling your child also depends on the number of days that you have “classes”. Avoid fatigue for both you and the child. Always keep it fresh, interesting, and to the point. The fewer days you choose, the more hours you will need to put in on the days that you are going to be teaching.

### Typical homeschooling hours

An exact timetable or hours of teaching is something that a lot of people still debate about. The argument is that you can not box in teachable moments to a certain time. However, at the same time, it helps to know that your child has gotten in the required number of hours in a week at least. The joy of teaching your child at home means that you have the freedom to explore.

If you would like structure, you could work with weekly targets. For children up to grade 2, you may target up to 3hours 4days a week. For children up to 4th grade, 2 to 3 hours for 4 days in a week. for grades 5 to 6, you may target 3 to 4 hours also for 4 days a week. For grades 7 to 8, 4 to 6 hours should do, whilst grades 9 to 10 may need up to 6 hours for 5 days a week. For high schoolers, approximately 16 hours of lessons in a week should be enough.

This schedule is according to [https://www.homeschoolingdownunder.com/how_many_hours_do_you_homeschool/](https://www.homeschoolingdownunder.com/how_many_hours_do_you_homeschool/ "https://www.homeschoolingdownunder.com/how_many_hours_do_you_homeschool/")

It is not the holy grail but will serve as a guide to getting in a decent amount of time for your child's studies.

## One last thing

The beauty of homeschooling means that you can choose the times that your child spends on their studies. The risk is in not getting in enough hours. Whilst a lot of regulatory authorities will want to know your lesson plan, they will not need to know the exact hours that you would have spent on each lesson.

The homeschool times that you choose will be better suited to your child's needs and the subjects that you are teaching. It may be better for you to focus on how well your child or children is getting through their studies and also on the structure. Go with a schedule that suits both your child and your family's needs.
