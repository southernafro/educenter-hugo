There are many reasons why you might decide to homeschool your children, and just as many benefits to that practice. You are checking for Statistics because you want to know if homeschooling will work for you and your child.

Truth is there no definite answer to that question. Statistics show that homeschool students come from families of all different backgrounds, just like students in traditional schools. Yet these same statistics can paint a picture of the commonalities found in homeschooling families.

The thing is out of dissatisfaction with the school system, concern about the school environment, religious reasons, desire for a non-conventional approach, or the specific needs of the child, parents turn to homeschool as an alternative to public or private schools. Many parents have resorted to homeschooling their kids and today we are going to be looking at some of the statistics of that.

## Facts and Statistics About Homeschooling

### 1.The top reason for homeschooling

80% of parents surveyed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) between 2015 and 2016 reported that ''a concern about the environment of other schools,'' namely, ''safety, drugs, or negative peer pressure,'' was the greatest motivator for homeschooling their children, according to a 2016 report entitled Parent and Family Involvement in Education: Results from the National Household Education Surveys Program of 2016.

Statistics show that the school environment is the top concern of homeschooling families. Homeschool attendance is steadily growing in the United States; for example, the number of homeschooled children nearly doubled between 1999 and 2016. What's behind the growth of the homeschooling trend?

### 2. How many homeschoolers are there in the world?

A number of countries have strictly regulated homeschooling programmes that work parallel to or as an extension of the existing school system. In contrast, others have banned it entirely and view the practice as undesirable.

With homeschooling still illegal in many countries, the total number of homeschooled children in the world is still under three million. The countries with most homeschooled children are the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

### 3. How many children are homeschooled in the United States? (NHERI)

Homeschool statistics by state show California, North Carolina, and Texas have the most homeschooling students, with over 100,000 pupils each. The lower end of the homeschooling statistics by state scale shows the states of Vermont, Wyoming, and Connecticut have the lowest number of homeschoolers under 3000 students.

The number of homeschooled children in the United States in spring 2019 was estimated at about 2.5 million. With that number, homeschooling studies show the United States is home to the majority of the world’s homeschoolers. The number of homeschoolers by the state is directly influenced by each state’s regulations and laws. So, you should check local regulations before embarking on the homeschooling journey.

### 4. The United Kingdom has the second-highest number of homeschoolers. (BBC, NHERI)

With 100,000 homeschooled students, the UK has the second-highest number of homeschoolers. The number of homeschoolers in the UK has increased by a whopping 40% over the past three years. Canada and Australia follow with 95,000 and 55,000 homeschooled children. A significant drop follows, and we find New Zealand with 6000 and South Africa with 500.

Homeschooling data shows Germany, France, Taiwan, and Ireland all have from 400 to 600 students, while the Netherlands, Kenya, Brazil, Ukraine, Switzerland, Poland, and Bulgaria have under 100 homeschooled children.

### 6. Compulsory School Attendance Can Delay Early Homeschool Graduation.

Homeschooling families follow the laws in their home states. Even with compulsory school attendance, homeschooling families in Idaho can teach almost any subject they like, and in whatever manner that appeals to them whether it's primarily through textbook-based instruction, the Socratic method, or video lessons, or even a combination thereof.

Several states have compulsory school attendance for children up to a certain minimum age. So, if a homeschooled child in a place like Idaho graduates from high school at 14 or 15, homeschool must continue until his or her 16th birthday. In this case, the extra time could be used to explore the college curriculum, delaying the homeschooled high school student for early college graduation.

### 7. Homeschooling is experiencing a steady growth rate of 2% to 8% every year. (NHERI)

This rate is observed as much in countries just setting off on the homeschooling path, like France, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, and Thailand, as well as those experienced in the field, such as the UK, Australia, Canada, and the US. While this varies from year to year, some statistics for homeschooling report significant growth.

### 8. Homeschool statistics show that up to 24.5% of all homeschooled children have enrolled at least one if not more grades above their age level (HSLDA)

One of the benefits of homeschooling statistics is that it allows the students to advance at their own pace, which often results in moving faster than their age group. This should also be taken into consideration when comparing statistics of homeschooling vs public schooling.

### 9. Homeschooling academic statistics show the achievement gap for homeschoolers gets significantly wider by fifth grade (HSLDA)

Are homeschooled students smarter? Not inherently, but the individual attention they receive and the learning conditions that allow for growth at one’s own speed result in higher results and skill levels.

Studies on homeschooling show that students in the early years advance at a pace that puts them one grade higher than the rest of their peers in the conventional schooling system.

By the fifth grade, that gap widens, resulting in up to four years of difference by eighth grade. So, those students perform four grade levels above what’s considered to be the national average. The latest homeschooling stats tell us the highest academic achievement among homeschoolers is recorded in those students who have been homeschooled their whole life.

### 10. Homeschoolers score 15% to 30% higher than public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests (HSLDA)

For those wondering why homeschooling is better. When observing the national average homeschooled students do more than well. In fact, their test scores are up to 30% higher than those of public school pupils. This trend is constant for every subject and for every grade level of the ITBS and TAP batteries. Homeschool vs public school stats shows homeschoolers score 85% to 87%, while their peers in public schools stand at 50%.

### 12. Nearly 5.7 million Americans have been homeschooled at some point during the course of their education (NHERI)

According to the text, one of the largest studies of homeschooled students found that more than 3.4 million adult Americans have been homeschooled for at least one year during their education, and this lasted six to eight years on average. An estimated 5.7 million people in the US have been or are currently homeschooled. The benefits of homeschooling grow over time.

### 13. Homeschoolers’ scores stayed between 80% and 90% regardless of their parents’ education (HSLDA)

Homeschooling research has shown that one thing that makes no difference when it comes to homeschooling is whether the student’s parents had graduated from college or had not finished high school. This is not the case for public schools, where children with parents of lower education score evidently lower than those of college graduates or higher.

Also, stats on homeschooling show the homeschoolers scored around 85%, regardless of the degree of state control and regulation that is imposed in their region. Those factors have no influence over their academic achievement.

## Recent Facts

As of late, it is believed that more parents have decided to homeschool their kids due to the current global pandemic. As schools have been closed for a while most parents do not want to have to wait a year so that their kids may resume the school year. With that being said a recent statement showed that more than half of parents with school kids are seeing homeschool as more favorable.

According to Wikipedia, Homeschooling is legal in many countries. Countries with the most prevalent home education movements include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Some countries have highly regulated home education programs as an extension of the compulsory school system; few others, such as Germany, have outlawed it entirely. In some other countries, while not restricted by law, homeschooling is not socially acceptable, or considered undesirable and is virtually non-existent.

## Final Thoughts

Homeschooling is a viable option for those who feel that their children aren’t learning enough, are falling prey to peer pressure, or are exposed or susceptible to too much violence in school. Homeschooling has statistically proven over time that it is a method of education that succeeds with test scores surpassing those in public schools.

In conclusion, homeschooling is on the rise in so many states all over the world especially in the United States, but it can be a mystery to those who have never participated. The question on so many minds: Why do families choose to homeschool? Must they follow one nationwide standard? Check above for the answer and see why so many people are resorting to homeschooling their kids.
