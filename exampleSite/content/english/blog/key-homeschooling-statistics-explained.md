We all know what homeschooling is. We also know that it comes with its benefits and demerits depending on the environment and the settings are provided for the one learning in such a setup. 

While learning can come in different ways, homeschooling, in particular, has different forms of learning which are what we are going to be looking at today. While there are different ways to homeschool, the right approach will depend heavily on your goals.

When it comes to choosing the best homeschooling method, you have to understand and know the people who are going to be affected by it. In this case, you have to know the strengths and weaknesses of your child so that you pick the right method for them. That means that the “best” homeschool method is simply the one that meets your and their specific criteria. The following are the five most common methods of homeschooling.

### Traditional Homeschooling

Traditional homeschooling is vitally doing school at home with the use of methods that are similar to those you find in public or private schools. Since most parents are familiar with this mode of education you will find that new parents in terms of homeschooling often buy textbooks and all learning material which you may find in a regular classroom. Although many families migrate away from this style as they gain more confidence in homeschooling.

In addition, traditional homeschoolers usually utilize a lecture teaching style, have their days solidly scheduled. They make frequent use of tests and quizzes to track progress just like in regular schools. They also try to align their curriculum with what their local school follows. It is a very common approach with those who want to get homeschooling done properly and accurately and to produce the best experience for their kid.

### Roadschooling

As of late, road schooling has become a growing trend amongst those who love traveling as well as learning. Roadschooling is a growing trend in which you will find families packing up their belongings and taking their homeschooling on the road. Many people who deal with road schooling find a way to integrate what they are experiencing on the road into their kid’s life and homeschool curriculum. However, it will obviously look and feel different for every family.

With this type of homeschooling, you will find that most of the homeschoolers become able to use the attractions they see as a means for educational enhancement in their studies. Besides that, it surely is a great way to study as it is not as boring as being stuck at home in your room with a textbook. This hands-on, experiential way of learning appeals to many families and accounts for the growth of road schooling nationwide.

### Worldschooling

When it comes to world schooling it is a test of wills. While every world schooling family is unique, some of the sentiments they share in common often include a preference for experiential learning to solidify knowledge, desire to travel, wish to introduce children to the wider world around them, need for flexibility in exploring children’s talents that traditional schooling cannot provide.

Worldschooling is an educational movement that recognizes that a student can receive no greater education than by experiencing and interacting with the world around them. It’s also important to keep in mind the myriad of ways to incorporate world culture in your child’s education. For families able to make it work, this often involves traveling together and using the journeys to enhance their kid’s education.

Still, others may only be able to take the occasional world journey but will focus heavily on subjects like geography, social studies, and world culture. Some families, for instance, might travel to a country and enroll their children in schools there with the goal of culture and language immersion.

### Unschooling

Well, unlike the name, this type of learning is completely different from what its name suggests. Unschooling is a style of home education that allows the student’s interests and curiosities to drive the path of learning. Unlike having the teachers or the parents set out a curriculum for them.

With this type of homeschooling, the ball is in the learner’s hands. They trust the children to gain knowledge in an organic fashion. Unschooling is an active learning process and not the passive, unstructured method that its terminology would suggest. Unschoolers are homeschoolers who are focused more on the experimental process of learning and becoming educated than with doing school.

This type mostly involves nurturing a child’s natural curiosity, without placing artificial time constraints on them such as the introduction of certain subjects at certain ages, or without structuring their day in the same way a classroom setting might.

### Classic Homeschooling

With the classic approach of homeschooling, the end goal is to allow and to teach kids to think for themselves and not rely on anyone else. Using the trivium model, children move through three main stages of learning: concrete learning which is the grammar stage, then they go on to critical learning which is the logic stage, and abstract learning the rhetoric stage. It’s a language-focused, literature-focused style of learning that has been adopted by so many homeschooling families till today.

#### Stages of Classic Homeschooling

**The Grammar Stage** - For homeschoolers, this boils down to making sure a student has core knowledge of math, language arts, science, and social studies. Because children in the early elementary years most often think in concrete terms, the focus of learning in these years is on memorization and repetition. Just as grammar is the foundation for language learning, the grammar stage of the trivium involves the years where children are building foundational knowledge in many educational arenas.

**The Logic Stage** – Also known as the dialectic stage is whereby a student has reached fifth grade, concrete thinking gives way to more analytical reasoning. At this level, students want to know more and ask questions. They want to be able to compare different values and understand a deeper volume. The word most apt for this stage is, “why?” Homeschooling a child during the dialectic stage involves introducing them to logic asking questions that help them arrive at valid conclusions.

**The Rhetoric Stage** – Classically homeschooled high schoolers will focus heavily on the medium of communication. They will learn about essay writing, public speaking, accounting, engineering, politics, and economics. The student combines their foundational knowledge from elementary school with the critical thinking skills they learn in middle school to be able to articulate their reasoned opinions and conclusions via debates and persuasive writing.

## Final thoughts

Choosing the best method for your child’s homeschooling is not as hard as you may think. Focus on the end goals and what you want your child to achieve at the end. That way things are so much easier for you.
