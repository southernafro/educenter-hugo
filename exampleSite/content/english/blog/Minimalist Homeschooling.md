Minimalist homeschooling is about focusing on the educational values you want to see in your children, and yourself. Not in the facts and accomplishments, or whatever your homeschooling friends are doing. 

Relaxed or minimalist homeschooling is an approach where, like the same movement in life to remove the extras and keep the things that matter, learning is cut down to the important things only with lots of space and free time for additional learning.

Additionally, relaxed homeschooling families are often very intentional about keeping their lessons short. After all, spending 5 or 6 hours a day on schoolwork wouldn’t be very relaxing now, would it? 

Minimalist or Relaxed homeschooling will look different from house to house, but the majority of relaxed homeschoolers tend to focus their structured learning time around the 3 Rs- reading, writing, and arithmetic. Other resources used may include:

* unit studies
* living books
* notebooking
* hands-on activities

## Pros and Cons

Minimalist homeschooling is quite common, we just don’t know it that’s all. It’s kind of a cross-breed of unschooling with formal learning although the approach to the basic subjects may be done from any other form of methodology as the family desires. In many homeschooling methods, there is a sense that learning needs to include a wide and demanding set of lessons, subjects, and activities.

In minimalist homeschooling, the idea is to cut out all these extras activities and focus primarily on the things they deem important. When a person embraces any minimalist mindset, it’s extremely personal. The same is true when you approach homeschooling this way. 

Each family may choose different things to learn that are important to them in general or at a specific time. Anyway like any other type of homeschooling, it comes with its advantages and disadvantages.

### Pros

* It’s very personalized to the needs of the children being taught.
* It’s relaxed and a lot less stressful than some other homeschool methods
* It works well with a large family
* It allows for a lot of free time

### Cons

* Since it focuses on only what the family deems important, subject gaps may exist
* It can take a while to settle into a rhythm that works for your family
* It can often involve a lot of group learning, which might not work with your family dynamics
* It involves a mindset change to allow that less is more.

## Facts about homeschoolers

1. Most homeschool families are not locked up in their homes all day.
2. Not all homeschoolers have large families.
3. Homeschool kids are very social.
4. Homeschool kids are very smart. Most homeschool children test way above the public school standards.

## Other types of Homeschooling

### Online (or Virtual) Public School

These students are not homeschoolers in the legal sense because they are enrolled in a public school. I’m including it here because a growing number of families in the homeschool community are actually part of the virtual public school system. They want the freedom of having their kids at home, but want or need the oversight and accreditation provided by a state-run school.

Instruction takes place in the home, either through computer lessons or via textbooks, typically a combination of both. Lessons may be completed online and somewhat self-paced or taught by a teacher through Skype or a similar method.

### Unit Studies

A unit study incorporates multiple subjects using one theme. The theme can be a historical event, a holiday, a location, a person, or pretty much anything. The students learn about the theme using different resources and hands-on activities. 

Unit studies are popular with Delight-Directed Learning (also called Interest-Led Learning), where students look at many subjects within the context of a specific topic.

### Classical

Classical education is based on a three-part process: Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric. In the Grammar stage, you lay the groundwork; learning how to learn. The Logic stage begins around fifth grade and focuses on reasoning and analytical thinking.

High school students move into the Rhetoric stage, which applies the rules of logic to the foundation of skills learned at the younger ages. Classical education is language-based, rather than hands-on or video-based like many of the other homeschooling styles.

It involves teaching based on the three stages of learning: the Grammar stage, the Logic stage, and the Rhetoric stage. The Grammar stage involves learning facts, memorization, and knowledge gathering. The Logic stage is when reasoning and logic begin to be applied to knowledge. The Rhetoric stage completes the Trivium and is when the student learns the skills of wisdom and judgment.

### Unschooling

Unschooling operates on the premise that we are naturally curious, and children don’t have to be forced to learn. We learn all day, every day, and if we allow ourselves to follow our interests, there is a never-ending web of knowledge out there just waiting for us. And “us” includes your kids.

Unschooled kids may spend hours playing video games, and they may just as likely spend hours reading or building something or playing outside. Unschooling does not mean that parents can never teach anything to their children, or that children should learn about life entirely on their own without the help and guidance of their parents.

Unschool­ing does not mean that parents give up active participation in the education and development of their children and simply hope that something good will happen. A large component of unschooling is ground­ed in doing real things, not because we hope they will be good for us, but because they are intrinsi­cally fascinating. There is an energy that comes from this that you can't buy with a curriculum.

## Final Thoughts

Though contradictory to its name, relaxed homeschooling or should we term it minimalist homeschooling is not as relaxed as it appears to be. If you want to take on this type of homeschooling, you have to be prepared and ready to take on a lot of responsibility and to monitor your child's actions. It is a good teaching method for kids as they concentrate on things that actually matter and can be used in life. They just have to concentrate on specific things in their academic journey.
