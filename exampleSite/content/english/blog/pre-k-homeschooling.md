Are you wondering about pre-k homeschooling? From the moment you find out that your family is growing many things begin to run through your mind as each day goes by. This includes your child's education. The world has many options nowadays for education, however not all of them are the best for your little one or you.

In this article, we will take a look at some of the structures that you may want to put in place in order to homeschool your child in pre-K. Providing the right environment and consistency is key. Children will respond to structure and routine, and this may involve following a curriculum for effective homeschooling. Let's take a look at some of the pre-K homeschooling options.

## When should I start homeschooling?

Pre k is a good time to begin homeschooling your little one. At this age, they are very receptive and willing to soak in just about anything that you teach them. It is important that you structure your lessons in short bursts. Their attention span is not entirely honed yet, so you will probably be able to get a good 15minutes in before they start to wander off.

## What will I need to start pre-K homeschooling?

The great thing about homeschooling is that your home, your yard, and your everyday utensils are the perfect tools. You can get creative with what you have at your disposal. This is especially perfect when you have to homeschool your child. Whether this is a choice you make on your own or it is forced upon you by global pandemics, like the COVID 19 induced quarantine, learning how to homeschool your child is a great asset.

It helps to read ahead and know what to expect. Get yourself a stash of stationery that is both colorful and functional. This list includes crayons, paints, paper, blunt tip scissors. Glue sticks, rulers, dry erase markers, paintbrushes, reading books, charts, and visual aids.

## Set up a time table

In order to begin homeschooling, it is important to set up structures and consistent times. The sooner your child understands that school time begins at a certain time in a particular place, the better. Consistency is key. You may also get lesson plans that will outline what to teach and for how long. The key is to take your child through the lessons all while keeping them captivated.

Your toddler needs to be in a space where they know what's coming next. It helps them prepare mentally. And also anticipate what they enjoy most. With time, they begin to single out parts of their day that they enjoy, and when they know to anticipate it, it makes your job easier.

## What should the curriculum look like?

The great thing about homeschooling is that you can tailor it. You can make it as complex or as simple as you need it to be, taking into consideration, your child's needs and your skill level. For instance, you can not include music lessons, when you are not musically inclined or trained to teach it.

The amount of detail that you include, in your time table, depends on your preference. For some people, they prefer detailed lesson plans, whilst others depend heavily on going with the flow.

## Examples of curriculum

There are a number of curriculum plans that you can download and follow. The curriculum needs to outline lessons involved, activities that can both teach and stimulate. One such example is the time for the learning curriculum.

It is important to make sure that the curriculum that you choose is not too serious. Whilst children respond to structure, they love learning through playtime, and they respond well to visual aids and singing silly songs. Find a curriculum that incorporates things that will capture your little one's attention, at the same time teaching them what they need to know.

## What should I make sure my child learns in pre k homeschool?

Whilst there are many curriculums that you could follow, there are a few basics that you will need to make sure are included. Such as identifying shapes and colors, reciting the alphabet and also identifying the sounds and knowing which letter is which. You can help them practice this by teaching them how to write their name and learning to identify letters on a page.

Identification of shapes and colors and sounds can also be enhanced by getting your child to match shapes and colors, using building blocks, and charts to label everyday items, and help your child associate the words, with the colors and shapes of things.

You also want to help your child learn how to count. What may be termed as mathematics in “grown-up school”. Practice writing and sounding the numbers. Singing along songs do a good job of helping them memorize. You also want to make sure that your child knows how to hold a pencil. You can practice this as well as writing and drawing. This is where the bulk of the paper on the stationery list will go.

You can also help them with language skills, by telling them a story and asking them to retell it. This will sharpen their language comprehension skills. Also, practice tracking words across the page. Whilst you can't expect them to know how to read at this stage, reading to them whilst you track the words with your finger helps show them which way is coming and which way is going.

## Conclusion

Homeschooling is an interesting choice that gives you as the parent of a guardian several choices and control over your child's education. As you choose the curriculum, make sure that you have the right resources, and most of all, that you have fun with your toddler as the lessons go on.
