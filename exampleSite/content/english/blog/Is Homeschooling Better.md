Every educational system offers great opportunities for children to learn new information and skills, as well as harness their own unique qualities and interests. Homeschooling is no different than public school, private school, charter school, unschooling, and other models in that there are pros and cons.

You are probably wondering if homeschooling is better for your child or yourself right? Well, today we are looking at if homeschooling is better or not. We will be looking at what homeschooling is exactly and how it will benefit your child. Types of homeschooling as well and the downside of homeschooling.

## What is homeschooling?

Homeschooling means learning outside of the public or private school environment. The word "home" is not really accurate, and neither is "school." For most families, their "schooling" involves being out and about each day, learning from the rich resources available in their community, environment, and interactions with other families who homeschool.

Essentially, homeschooling involves a commitment by a parent or guardian to oversee their child or teen's educational development. As you probably know, when you decide to homeschool, you will take on the duties and responsibilities of both a teacher and administrator. These responsibilities get added to your normal role as a parent. You also have the added financial costs of homeschooling.

You will need to implement lessons, organize field trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure you are compliant with state and local homeschool requirements. While there are many free resources available, homeschool supplies such as textbooks, books, paper, art supplies, computers, software, and other homeschool tools cost money.

## Types of Homeschooling

### Traditional Homeschooling

Traditional homeschooling is vitally doing school at home with the use of methods that are similar to those you find in public or private schools. Since most parents are familiar with this mode of education you will find that new parents in terms of homeschooling often buy textbooks and all learning material which you may find in a regular classroom. Although many families migrate away from this style as they gain more confidence in homeschooling.

### Roadschooling

With this type of homeschooling, you will find that most of the homeschoolers become able to use the attractions they see as a means for educational enhancement in their studies. Besides that, it surely is a great way to study as it is not as boring as being stuck at home in your room with a textbook. This hands-on, experiential way of learning appeals to many families and accounts for the growth of road schooling nationwide.

### Worldschooling

When it comes to world schooling it is a test of wills. While every world schooling family is unique, some of the sentiments they share in common often include a preference for experiential learning to solidify knowledge, desire to travel, wish to introduce children to the wider world around them, need for flexibility in exploring children’s talents that traditional schooling cannot provide. Worldschooling is an educational movement that recognizes that a student can receive no greater education than by experiencing and interacting with the world around them.

### Unschooling

Well, unlike the name, this type of learning is completely different from what its name suggests. Unschooling is a style of home education that allows the student’s interests and curiosities to drive the path of learning. Unlike having the teachers or the parents set out a curriculum for them. With this type of homeschooling, the ball is in the learner’s hands. They trust the children to gain knowledge in an organic fashion.

### Classic Homeschooling

With the classic approach of homeschooling, the end goal is to allow and to teach kids to think for themselves and not rely on anyone else. Using the trivium model, children move through three main stages of learning: concrete learning which is the grammar stage, then they go on to critical learning which is the logic stage, and abstract learning the rhetoric stage. It’s a language-focused, literature-focused style of learning that has been adopted by so many homeschooling families till today.
