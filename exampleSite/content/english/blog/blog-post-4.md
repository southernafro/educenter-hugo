Now there are a few laws that have to be followed for you to be able to homeschool your child.

## Legal Requirements for Homeschooling

* Your child may also be taught in another family’s home or you may use a tutor for instruction.
* Local school officials do have the right to make a “reasonable inquiry” to determine whether your school-aged child is attending a private school. A 2010 letter from the Texas commissioner of education gives direction to school districts on how to legally make a “reasonable inquiry.”
* The instruction must be bona fide (i.e., not a sham).
* The curriculum must be in visual form (e.g., books, workbooks, video monitor).
* The curriculum must include the five basic subjects of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics, and good citizenship.
* Good citizenship is similar to civics. Public schools teach one semester of civics, usually in the senior year of high school. Teaching U.S. and Texas history, government (theoretical and practical), the Pledge of Allegiance, and similar activities will also help meet this requirement. THSC provides several ways to help you meet this requirement.
* There is no need to register or in any way contact the local school or the state government prior to homeschooling unless your student is currently in public school.
* If your child has never been enrolled in public school, simply obtain a curriculum and begin. It is also to your advantage to find a local support group to help you in this endeavor.
