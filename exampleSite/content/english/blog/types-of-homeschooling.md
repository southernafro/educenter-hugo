When it comes to education we all want what’s best for either ourselves or our kids. We are each unique and so is every child when it comes to learning, and the option that might be best for you or your child may not be the best for the next kid or the next person.

Many people are concerned about the quality of the education they get from homeschooling over public schooling, we are here to help you make the right choice.

Homeschooling is basically schooling or learning at home. It has become quite the progressive movement in recent years as more and more parents choose homeschooling over public schooling for their children.

If you are here you are probably wondering if homeschooling is best for your kid or not. Well, everything has its pros and cons. We’ll look at each of the two methods and you decide for yourself which one is best.

## Homeschooling

As stated before, homeschooling is basically learning or schooling at home. No need to rush to catch the bus. No need to worry about any school bullies. It is just regular school at home without the unnecessary fuss that comes with actually having to go to school.

It is important to consider many factors before deciding whether your child should stay at home to learn or should be sent to a regular public school.

### Benefits

Homeschool is very beneficial to both the one taking it and the one sponsoring it. That is it makes life so much easier for both the kids and the parents. Generally from costs to routines, it lessens the tight hold on certain regulations that make learning a bit boring. So check out why homeschooling may be a good option.

* Homeschooling offers more specialized educational attention for special needs children. Unlike most public schools that use the same teaching methods for all children.

* When it comes to homeschooling you find that children progress faster and learn faster than in a public school setting.

* When you choose to homeschool, you won’t have to worry about tuition fees, transport, food, and stationery costs. So you may think that homeschooling is less expensive when compared to public schools. In terms of the operational costs.

* Homeschool can save time for both you and your kid since you won’t have to transport your kids to and from school every day. You also don’t have to worry about making them late for school and so forth.

* Schooling at home may promote a closer familial relationship. You’ll find that many parents find that they enjoy spending extra time with their kids in homeschool.

* Well, most people who undertake to homeschool believe that home is the safest, most secure environment in which a child can learn. At home, a child does not have to deal with peer pressure or with fitting-in with the popular cliques. A child can just “be.” This gives the child the opportunity to focus on the lessons being taught and on the educational expectations required of him or her.

### Demerits

Like everything on this earth. It has an upside and a downside. Homeschooling, though it makes things easier for the parties involved in it. You may find that certain life skills and structures will be lacking because of homeschooling. Check the demerits below.

* When you choose to educate your child at home, you have to put your career goals or ambitions aside and shift your focus to teaching the child. Unless of course, you hire someone to do it for you.

* Public Schooling education will expose your child, although minimally, to a variety of topics. In homeschooling, parents can choose to limit or even eliminate the subject from their curriculum, leaving the child with no knowledge of it. Also, it is not possible for a parent to teach complex topics in subjects such as math, physics, chemistry, or calculus unless they are experts. This limits the amount of information that a child gets through homeschooling.

* Public schools are more structured and have a better-planned curriculum than home-schools. The school’s system has tried and tested teaching methodologies, credible sources of information, and standardized assessments. They even select some of the best teachers to give your child the best education. Something which some parents may fail to do.

* When a child is educated at home, he has little interaction with other kids of his age. Even if he does, he does not get to experience the same things as school-going children. They do not get to experience school or class trips and projects or lunch with friends.

## Public Schooling

Well now that you know about homeschooling. Let’s look at public schooling. Well depending on where you are, these are mostly schools that are run and controlled as well as structured by the government. Each child is an individual with individual needs. The environment offered by the school is the determining factor as to whether a child will enjoy it there or not.

### Benefits

* Public schools have a built-in structure. We all know that young children thrive on routine and they require a lot of attention and care. If you are trying to homeschool your children while also being a stay-at-home parent, you may find it more challenging than you imagine.

* Many public schools offer sports and elective options like art and music. Not all kids are sporty and not all kids are artsy. So you’ll find that in public schools your kid has the option to choose what they like without restrictions.

* A public school teaches children a certain degree of independence. Depending on the grade, children need to keep track of their own class schedules, find their way from one class to another, purchase their own lunch, and make it to and from the bus every day.

* Children who attend public schools have more opportunities for social interaction than many homeschool students. There are homeschool co-ops that can be helpful, but a public school has built-in social benefits.

* Public school gives you and your child some much-needed time apart which helps to foster your child’s independence and gives you a break as well. There is no harm in needing a break from your kids once in a while.

### Demerits

Apart from offering you a helping hand in raising your kid. Public schools also have risks. Your child may not be well suited for public learning and here is why.

* Public schools have a more rigorous and regimented schedule than most homeschool programs and students may not have the same degree of freedom and flexibility to customize their education.

* With public schooling, your kid is exposed to a lot of peer pressure and identity crisis. What they may think is cool. May actually not be the best choice of character for their lives.

* Bullies and social behaviors may force your child to have a very unstable social setting. They may end up being very antisocial or may not be as open to you as they were before.

* Anything can happen at a public school. From kidnapping, abuse, shoot outs. Mixing different children from different backgrounds may result in a lot of confusion to your kid which you may not find very settling.

## Final Thoughts

Public schools come with everything. Some have libraries, sports centres, transport facilities, and the security that you may feel your child needs. They also have rules and regulations that your child may have to follow and failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.

Proponents of homeschooling believe that children thrive better in a safe, comfortable environment with which they are familiar. It makes it easier for them to understand everything without worrying about the bully waiting to steal their lunch.

So let's look at the benefits and the demerits that come with homeschooling. The choice is yours, as you know what is best for yourself and for your kid
