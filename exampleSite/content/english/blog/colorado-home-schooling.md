The State of Colorado has a long history of homeschooling. In fact, home-schooled students enrolled in public schools for the first time in 1985, starting with only a few dozen students. By the 2010-2011 academic year, the [Colorado Department of Education](https://www.cde.state.co.us/) reported that out of the approximately 92,000 school-aged children in the state of Colorado, more than 33,000 were being homeschooled.

This number continues to rise, but the overall increase is not as great as it once was. The reasons for this are many and include changes in the state's homeschooling laws, more opportunities for homeschooling parents, and a general increase in the public's awareness of homeschooling.

As a homeschooling parent, you need to consider several factors when deciding what school year to enroll your child. The following are a few of the things you should consider:

## What type of class is the child being enrolled in?

Â In Colorado, elementary school is divided into 4 levels: Pre-K, K, 1st, 2nd. These classifications have many conditions attached to them. For example, a child must be 5 years old by September 1st to enroll in Pre-K. Besides, you must have also vaccinated the child according to Colorado State law.

The same classifications are used for middle school and high school students. In Colorado, middle schools are classified at levels 5th through 8th grade, while high schools are classified as 9th through 12th.

Enrollment is based on your child's age on September 1st of the current year only. When enrolling in classes, your child must be 6 of the next school year.

To attend school outside of their home, students must obtain a "school yearbook pass." This is a daily pass given to students that allows them to be in their public school building.

Should your student change schools or homes during the school year, they will have to apply for a new school book pass. The cost for this is $5 per day. Students are only allowed 1 book pass per teacher per semester. 

## Homeschooling laws in colorado

home school laws require that parents are educated on the process of homeschooling.

Before a parent can start homeschooling, they must complete a proper application at the school district level. The student must be enrolled in a public school for at least one full year to apply. The district will then determine if the student is eligible to take the classes based on their study history and/or performance in public schools.

## Colorado homeschooling laws and regulations

As a parent, you will need to choose a learning program to follow.

The first step in choosing a program is to determine your educational preferences. Do you prefer the classical model of learning or one that is more structured and formal? Are you interested in Christian-based education?

As a homeschooling parent, you are responsible for identifying the most appropriate and effective program for your student. A bit of research will help you find the right match for your child's learning style and needs.

Many schools have specific regulations on what can be used as a curriculum. Your child will need a current transcript from a public school to register with a homeschooling institution.

There are many homeschool associations in Colorado, and you are free to attend any one of them. Your child will need to be enrolled in the school for at least 1 full year to be considered active for homeschooling purposes.

## Registration

Parents must register with the school district in which they reside. If you are a new family moving into the area, you will need to let the district know of your intent to homeschool your child within 30 days of arrival.

You will need to submit proof of residency and your child's immunization records before registering for school. Once this is completed, your student may begin attending classes as an unclassified student with no specific class schedule.

As part of the registration process, you will be issued a school identification card.

 

## Progression

To progress, your child must demonstrate a mastery of the curriculum you have chosen. If your child is progressing well and gaining what you desire, you will need to continue using your chosen curriculum.

When your child passes the State Standards Test at the end of 5th grade, they may progress to 6th grade. They will be given 3 days off for this process. However, if they are out of school for longer than this time period, they must reapply for school before resuming their studies.

## Local Authorities

Local Authorities are not permitted to interfere in the school studies of a homeschooling student unless they have reasonable cause. Out of school is considered a reasonable cause.

## Parental Involvement

You must nurture the parent/teacher relationship throughout the duration of your child's homeschooling program. The parent must positively influence their child and provide them with strong moral and spiritual values.

## Colorado homeschool requirements

To enroll your child in school, you must register them with the school district. Make sure you visit the classroom where your child will be placed. Review any materials that are available to you ahead of time.

You will need to complete an application for homeschooling with the local school board if your child is new to the area or wants to transfer from another district. All parents must attend a minimum of two meetings each year regarding their child's education and attendance.

## Conclusion

As you can see, homeschooling is very different in Colorado than in other states. This is a very positive choice for parents if they believe it will meet their students' needs.

Colorado's Department of Education strongly recommends that parents, guardians, or legal representatives obtain professional assistance to organize and plan their student's education and home life if the parent plans to homeschool in Colorado.
