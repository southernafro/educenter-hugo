Is homeschooling expensive? That is probably the question on your mind right now. It’s also one of the toughest questions to answer, mostly because what is expensive to one family is cheap or reasonable for another.

Homeschooling costs vary extremely, depending on what method you use, what resources you use, how much work you can or want to do as a parent or teacher, and what extras you include in the process.

In this article, we are going to show you the costs to expect when dealing with homeschooling. These things differ so we can’t exactly tell you how much you are going to spend on homeschooling. 

However, what we can do is give you a rough idea of the things you are supposed to have on your budget for homeschooling to be a success.

## Homeschooling Costs

Although it isn’t something you think about too much when you are sending your child to public school, you’ll be interested to know that your costs for homeschooling will fall into three main categories:

### Cost 1: Curriculum Costs

Whether online or offline this will include general books and education supplies. Your curriculum will likely be your biggest expense when you start homeschooling, and prices run the gamut. 

You can create your own curriculum for free, or you can spend thousands of dollars. It all depends on your needs and how much time you have to put into researching bargains and planning lessons.

There are ways to reduce the costs related to the curriculum which are:

1. Use Khan Academy: The nonprofit Khan Academy is committed to providing free education to children around the world. That’s right, it’s 100% free, and many homeschooling families say it’s an excellent resource.
2. Use an Online Resource: Parents rank Time4Learning among the top homeschooling resources. The lessons are interactive, fun, and comprehensive, and it’s affordable. The website grades lessons track progress, offers a great forum for homeschooling parents, and allows children to learn independently at their own pace.
3. Buy Used: Buying a used curriculum can save you 25% to 50% or more off retail prices. One of the best places to find used curricula is Homeschool Classifieds. You can search for listings by grade level or specific curriculum, and there are thousands of new listings every day. You can also search listing sites such as eBay and Craigslist.
4. Rent: When you rent a curriculum this gives you a chance to try out a new curriculum without investing the full price. Check out Yellow House Book Rental to browse the curricula they have available for rent.
5. Split the Cost: This option works best if your children aren’t the same age so that you can stagger your use. For example, if your friend’s child is in second grade and yours is in first grade, she could use the curriculum first and then pass it on to you next year.

### Cost 2: Extracurricular activities

One of the challenges of homeschooling is that kids can feel very isolated. Signing them up for extracurricular activities is important. 

Kids want and need to socialize with others and learn how to work as a team. Many homeschooled kids take part in Community sports such as soccer, softball, basketball, or baseball or other things such as music, self-defense classes, and so forth.

You can often find inexpensive classes at community and recreation centers. Keep in mind that extracurricular activities can quickly overwhelm your family time and lead to an overscheduled child, which is something many homeschooling families try to avoid. 

Hence one should consider how well the activity supports the values they consider to be most important for the children, the benefits, and if it corresponds with the child’s natural talents.

### Cost 3: Field Trips

Field trips are a fun and important part of homeschooling. Many homeschooling families spend a couple of hundred dollars per year on field trips. 

Families that homeschool often take trips to the zoo, the symphony, the planetarium, a botanical garden, or a local historical site to get out of the house and make learning more hands-on.

However, the cost of these trips can really add up. Depending on where you live, you might also be able to join a local homeschooling co-op or group. 

These consist of local families who get together weekly or monthly to share teaching duties, build friendships, and take field trips together.

### Cost 4: Supplies & Equipment

Homeschooling supplies and equipment can be an expensive black hole if you’re not careful. If your kids are enrolled in public school, then you know how expensive back-to-school shopping is. 

Globes, solar system models, microscopes, an ant farm, fun decorations for your learning space. As you can see l things might get out of control real quick.

There are plenty of ways to save money if you homeschool, you’ll still have some of the same expenses you would if your child attended public school, but you definitely won’t need to spend as much. 

You won’t have to pitch in for miscellaneous expenses such as school fundraisers and class snacks. With homeschooling, your kids are freed from social pressures and often will be happy with what they’ve already got.

### Cost 5: Lost Income

As you already know, homeschooling requires a stay-at-home parent. That means you’ll have to transition to being to a one-income family if you aren’t one already. The loss of income is a huge consideration when deciding to homeschool. You’ll need to carefully weigh all your expenses to determine if you can live on a single income.

In addition to the financial cost, you also have to think about the time you’ll spend on research. As well as all the other additional costs that may come with homeschooling that other schools cover for in a tuition statement. Besides schools usually get discounts for educational purposes, but as a homeschooling parent, you may be charged a full price.

## Conclusion

This should give you an insight into the costs of homeschooling. It’s not specific and will depend highly on the decision you choose to make. Homeschooling doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Yes, it might be more expensive than the public school in some ways, but it’s definitely less expensive than a private school.
