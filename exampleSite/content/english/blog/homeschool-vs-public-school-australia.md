Your child's education is an important part of who they are. It largely influences who they will become and how they will relate to the world around them. With so much riding on the choices that you will make, it is important that you make the best choice, and this comes from having accurate information.

In this article, we take a look at homeschooling versus public school in Australia. We delve into what the two options entail, what they look like, how similar they are, and also how they differ, amongst other aspects. Let's dive in, shall we?

## Homeschool in Australia

Homeschooling in Australia is an option that entails teaching your child at home or having a private tutor come in to do the job. The child does not go to meet other children daily, and they follow a structure set by you. There are various homeschooling options at the same time, the different states in Australia, have various regulatory bodies for homeschooling. The time spent in a lesson can differ greatly depending on your teaching method.

## Public School Australia

Public school involves your child attending classes with other children his or her age in a school environment. The lessons are structured and so is the timetable. All public schools in Australia are mandated to stick to the Australian curriculum. The children take public exams and are tested at the same time of year. children who attend public schools can not prescribe how they learn. It is already set for them.

## Favourite Features

### Favorite Features Home-school in Australia

Homeschooling has a number of advantages. Our favorite features of this teaching method include giving the student the freedom to choose their path. Homeschooling allows students to explore their interests and build on those. There isn’t a set structure defining how the child should learn or how they should arrive at answers.

Also homeschooled children may have more freedom to speak up and ask their teacher because the teacher is someone close to them, such as a parent. We also like the fact that homeschool is flexible and can also cater to the various needs of the child which may be overlooked in public school.

### Favorite Features Public school in Australia

Public school has some advantages, and it’s the reason why it remains a staple and the only option for some parents. Some of our favorite characteristics of public school are that it provides a solid routine for the child. Public school has structure and discipline as the child has to be accountable to an authority figure.

Public school also has qualified teachers, who are trained to teach different subjects. Also, there is more time spent studying core subjects. Children meet with different people, and as such their worldview is opened up.

### Teachers skill

The skill level of the teacher counts a great deal. In public schools, the teachers are usually more qualified than homeschool teachers. Whilst a parent may be good at one subject, they may not be equipped to deal with all the subjects that their child needs to learn. In a public school set up, your child may have different teachers for different subjects.

### Exploration of the child's interests

In homeschool, children can explore their leisure interests. In public school, they work on a fixed schedule which can be prohibited. The level to which a child can pursue these interests in the homeschool also depends on the teaching method chosen.

### Socialization

Homeschooled children do not interact with other children daily. As such, this may make them less sociable, and more comfortable when they are alone or in their own space. Public school children on the other hand help integrate your child by allowing a real hands-on experience of how to deal with different characters daily.

## What could be better

### Home-school

* Children could be taught how to better integrate with society
* It’s a time-consuming activity for the parent, especially if they need to be at another job.
* It requires planning and knowledge of different academic subjects
* Your home may not have all the necessary facilities to efficiently teach your child.

### Public school

* Public school is less flexible
* It can not give your child the dedicated attention
* They can tend to be overcrowded

## Similar Features

* Both forms of education, are done between the ages of 5 and 18
* Homeschooling can teach the same core subjects taught in public school

## Key Differences

* Homeschool is done in your home whilst public school classes are conducted in a public classroom
* The curriculum in public schools is set and more structured than homeschooling, which can take on different forms.
* Public schools have more qualified teachers teaching your child whereas, in homeschooling, you are probably the only teacher that your child has.
* Public school has more facilities than you would probably have in your home
* Homeschooling can focus more on what the child is more interested in and what they can be stronger in
* Homeschooling can keep your child out of harms way if they are being bullied
* Public schooled children may also be more docile, due to being part of a number, whereas homeschooled children know that they have the full attention of their teacher or parent. This also gives them the confidence to explore more.
* Homeschooling also gives both the student and parent, control over the pace at which lessons are conducted, meaning there is less chance of being left behind in studies, as may be the case with public schooling.

## The verdict

If you are seeking a way to teach your child away from forces of peer pressure and exam pressure, then you may want to steer in the direction of homeschooling. Also, homeschooling lets you dictate your child's learning pace and content. If you want a flexible method of teaching, homeschooling will be a good choice.

However, if you prefer a more structured curriculum, as well as your child being more socially integrated then you can go with public schooling. It also gives your child facility options that you may not have at home, such as a science laboratory.
