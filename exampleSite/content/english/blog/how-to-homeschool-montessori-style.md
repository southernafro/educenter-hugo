Are you looking for ways to homeschool Montessori style? Homeschooling has taken many different turns and faces over the years. It has become a concept that more parents are considering for different reasons. Montessori style learning is a concept modeled after research by Italian medical doctor and educator. Her research gave way to an education philosophy that allowed for the child to have more control over what they learn and how they do it.

This is something that you may think needs to be regulated by a qualified educator. However there are ways to do this even when you have decided to homeschool your child.in this article we will take a look at homeschooling your child in Montessori style. Let's take a look, shall we?

## What is Montessori teaching?

The core belief of Montessori teaching is the belief that children are equipped enough to know how to lead their own learning experiences. It is a learning philosophy that originated over a century ago. This type of teaching is aimed at making sure that the student gets a holistic learning experience. This includes physically, mentally, emotionally all aimed at producing a well-rounded person.

The founder, Dr. Montessori, felt that children do not need to be guided by adults and what they think needs to be done. Whilst this type of teaching is unconventional, those who are fans of it may feel like they can only get this for their child at specific schools. Whilst this is true, you can also take the initiative and homeschool your child using the Montessori teaching method.

## Why should I use the Montessori teaching method?

Montessori is one of the methods that you may use to teach your child at home. But aside from the other more conventional means, why should any parent choose it over others. For a lot of people, it seems risky because it is less structured and it also means that you have to allow more freedom for your child to do what they want to do when they want to do it. This is a style a lot of parents are not acclimatized to.

Giving your child that freedom may seem like an absurd idea but it has its advantages. It helps develop the child’s sense of right and wrong, managing their own time, learning to be more observant, and deducing from their surroundings. Montessori teaching helps you see off the bat, what interests your child the most.

This method will let your child explore what they are most curious about and this means that you can therefore build upon that interest.

## How do I homeschool Montessori style?

## Create the classroom

The first thing that you will need to do is to put order in your home. Your home space will be your child’s classroom and since you want them to learn from their environment, the home is a big part of this. Make sure that everything is in its place and that the child knows where everything goes.

It’s a big lesson on its own for your child to know where things ought to go and for them to be more independent. You also want to make sure that things around the house are accessible for your child. Use low draws and shelves to store things. You may also make things more accessible for your child by placing a step stool so that they can easily reach the harder to reach places.

Ensure that there are designated places for toys and other such things around the house that your child uses. This will help to instill a sense of pride, ownership, and responsibility. The point is empowering the child to do things themselves. Also, rearrange your child's books and toys so that they see a different angle often.

## Get extra help around the house!

Whilst this may not seem like it is a way of teaching, getting your children to help out more around the house, giving them responsibility, is another way of teaching them life skills. You just need to make sure that the tasks that you give them are age-appropriate.

Incorporate tasks that will also help them concentrate better. To cultivate concentration, you can also give them what they seem to be more interested in. The great thing about homeschooling is that you can observe what your child prefers and provide the best environment. Montessori schooling is a great way to teach your child the lessons they need to learn and also at the same time equip them for the real world.

It is important to instill a sense of orderliness, self-control, and the ability to make their own choices. An orderly environment can promote progress and curiosity. As the child's teacher, you can chip in here and there for guidance, but the child is not reliant on you to learn.

The Montessori style focuses on hands-on learning and development of cognitive skills, this means that you can let your child explore their surroundings.

## Rewards and milestones

When your child does well, try to help them gain inner motivation rather than a reward from you, which can lead them to always seek external approval in life. Rather help them get to a place of appreciating the experience of learning, and the satisfaction of getting something done.

Montessori learning gets rid of the competitiveness that sometimes comes with traditional schools and testing. It instead encourages collaboration and cooperation as the child learns. If you think back at all the lessons you grasped more than others, you will realize that they mostly involved you interacting with the subject matter. Montessori learning allows this, and when you homeschool your child can do all this in familiar surroundings.

## Which resources can I start with?

You can start with reading [Dr. Montessorri’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori) books so that you gain a grasp of her teaching philosophy. For a guide on the curriculum to use, it is important that you are well versed with the homeschooling regulations of the area, as they can differ. It's important to make sure that you get a program for homeschooling in particular and not for classrooms.
