Are you wondering how long it will take your child who is being homeschooled to graduate? If you have been homeschooled from a very early age, then you are wondering how it all ends. When you get to the end of the line for the first half of your child's education, what happens next? In regular schools, you know that it takes a certain number of years (depending on your country and curriculum). But with homeschooling, you are not following the same structure or number of hours.

Most homeschoolers graduate by the time that they are 16 or 17. Several factors will dictate just how early or late your child can graduate. In this article, we take a look at some of those factors. Let's dive in, shall we?

## Are there any specific graduation requirements for homeschooled children?

Homeschooling in high school is not the easiest thing to do, because you are nearing the time when your child will need to graduate and move on to tertiary education. This means that you have the pressure of ensuring that they are adequately prepared. You are nearing the finish line, so your ducks have to be in a row.

The graduation requirements will differ according to where you are located. This is why you must take heed of the regulations in your state as you go through your homeschooling years with your child. However, you will be pleased to know that most states in the US do not have a governing law for homeschooling students.

## How does a homeschooled student get to graduate?

Most colleges and universities will need to see transcripts for the lessons that the child has taken. This is why a lot of homeschooling regulations will require that you document your child's progress and submit it at the end of the year. Keeping records allows you to have something to present to colleges if they ask for them. However, there isn’t one golden standard for colleges. This is mostly because state regulations can vary greatly.

Different colleges and universities have different admission requirements. The best way to know what is needed is to look at the college you and your child are considering, and get their specific set of requirements. There aren't any set laws by the state as to what they should ask for from applicants.

## How do I get a high school diploma when I'm homeschooled?

This is a question that a lot of parents who homeschool their high school children have. Homeschooling means that your child will not be taking the tests taken in public schools. Essentially, a high school diploma is a paper that states that you have completed your studies and as such, are eligible to move on.

You can prepare a homeschool diploma for your child, make sure that the diploma has certain characteristics. For instance, it has to have the child's full name, as it appears on his or her national documentation, the subjects, projects, and courses covered, as well as the fact that it is a high school diploma. It is important to note, however, that not all universities and colleges will accept this. That’s why you must know the exact requirements of the college or university.

Some will need your child to write an entrance test, whilst most colleges in the US will need SAT or ACT scores. It all depends on the college you want your child to go to.

## What determines the subjects or courses a homeschooled child takes?

A homeschooled child has the advantage of being able to explore their interests without being restricted by a structured curriculum and exams that may box in the way they think. This freedom to choose from their interest means that they have a clearer scope of what they may want to do the rest of their lives, which makes it easier to tailor the lesson plans through the years, on subjects that will sharpen and groom their passion.

Unlike in a public school, it's more likely that the child may not have as much clarity in knowing what they want to become, and hence this can make it difficult to know which subjects to specialize in.

The thing that most determines the subjects, is usually the child's interests along with the requirements of the college that they intend to go to.

## How much time do you need to go through homeschool?

The amount of time that it takes to go through homeschool depends on the number of classes that you take or teach. If you only have 1hour a day twice a week, it will take you much longer than a student that has class five days a week for 2 hours a day.

Typically one year of homeschooling will consist of about 180 days. The number of weeks this takes depends on the number of days that you conduct lessons. Some people may conduct lessons every day, whilst others prefer to take a day off. Doing this means that you can finish the year in 30 weeks.

The amount of time that it takes to graduate will depend on how long it will take to complete the student's credits in total. You can set your credit scores. As long as you can prove to the university and college authority, that your child was indeed enrolled in homeschool and they did certain subjects, you are on the right track.

## One last thing

The amount of time that it takes to graduate from homeschool depends on the total number of hours you spend per day. However, most homeschooled children will typically graduate, or be ready for tertiary education, by the time that they reach the age of 16 or 17. This also depends on the number of subjects that the child is taking.

It's important to not overwhelm the child with too many lessons in a day. Some time away is necessary, to refresh and regroup and also to keep it interesting. This way, your child will not dread going back to class as much. From start to graduation, homeschooling should take about 10 to 11 years.
