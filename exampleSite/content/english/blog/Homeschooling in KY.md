Like any legal state, there are regularly that govern it to make sure that the state is kept in order at all times. Even though at times we may find some of them to be unnecessary and just time consuming for no reason.

Homeschooling in Kentucky is quite a simple method and approach to your child’s education. However just as it is your responsibility to look out for your child’s education it is also your responsibility to look out for their homeschooling requirements as well.

The requirements to homeschool in Kentucky are some of the most straightforward and easy to follow in the country. Kentucky has no reporting requirement, no mandated standardized testing, and no portfolio review.

Today, we will look at a summary of the main regulations regarding homeschooling as well as how to notify your local superintendent of your intention to homeschool, what records you may want to keep, and even how to return to public school if you bring your homeschool to an end prior to your child’s graduation.

## Laws and Regulations

For a variety of academic and non-academic factors, some parents believe in the benefits of homeschooling their children. While professional educators urge extreme caution to those proceeding with this often overwhelming challenge.

It is imperative that parents and guardians opting for a homeschool environment equip themselves with the knowledge, information, contacts, and legal obligations pertaining to the establishment and daily operation needed for compliance.

Kentucky has no homeschool statute, homeschoolers fall under the “private schools” statute which makes the legal requirements simple. Under state law, all children between the ages of 6 and 18 must be enrolled in school.

This can include enrollment in a public, private, church, or homeschool. These are the basic Kentucky homeschool regulations to follow in terms of getting started:

### Notifications to the board of Education

Each year, notify the board of education in your county within 10 days of the beginning of the school year of your intention to homeschool. In order to homeschool your child in Kentucky, attendance records along with scholarships reports which are not submitted, but rather are kept in your own portfolio have to be made

### Time consumed

If you are planning to homeschool your child there is a certain time limit as to how short or long a school term should be. One had to teach a minimum school term of 1,062 instructional hours.

### What is taught

You have to ensure that you teach reading, writing, spelling, grammar, history, mathematics, and civics to your homeschooler of which these are minimum, you can certainly teach any additional subjects you choose.

Then again if your child is currently enrolled in a public, private, or church school in Kentucky, it is a good idea to send your current school a formal withdrawal letter when you first begin homeschooling, to let them know that your child will no longer be attending.

### Attendance records

While these items are the minimum required of homeschooling families in KY, there are multiple benefits of keeping an organized homeschool portfolio. For instance, if you return to public or private school, having a record of your child’s progress can help administrators place your child into the proper grade level.

Now if you homeschool during the high school years, all records that you keep will aid you in creating an accurate transcript that can be shared with potential colleges your child may wish to apply with. This will make things a whole lot easier for you and your child.

## Your Letter of Notification

This letter is best sent by certified mail and should be addressed to your local superintendent of schools. The letter should include the name of your homeschool, and the names, ages, and address of each child enrolled in your homeschool. For a sample letter of notification visit this link on the [Christian Home Educators of Kentucky organization]().

From the first time you begin homeschooling, whether it’s in kindergarten or in the middle of a school year, you have 10 days to file the initial letter of intent. Then, you simply continue to file it within the first two weeks of each school year as long as your homeschool stays active.

## Returning to Public School after Homeschooling

To switch from homeschooling to public school, you do not need to notify your public school superintendent. Instead, you would simply not renew your intention to homeschool the next time it is due. Homeschooling is a commitment, for sure, but it is also a commitment that needs to be reevaluated each year to determine if it is still working for your student and your family.

Keep in mind that when enrolling in a school after homeschooling, each school will have different protocols for determining placement. Some schools will simply ask you to decide what grade level you want to place your child.

Others may ask to review records relating to your child’s academic progress while homeschooling and some may even require assessment testing to determine proper placement.

If your family decides to suspend your homeschool endeavors before your child has graduated, you will then need to know how to enroll a homeschooled child in public school. Also, you would decide which school you will be transferring your student to and contact them to get their enrollment procedures.

## Final thoughts

In Kentucky they want you to feel confident in your decision to take your child’s education into your own hands. Armed with the pertinent information, a great mix of curriculum, and a support network, homeschooling can be one of the most rewarding educational choices of all.

Though in Kentucky homeschooling is referred to under private schooling the process of starting it is simple. In short, you just have to file a letter of intent to homeschool with your local county superintendent of schools.

Then you choose your curriculum. Which is up to the parents and lastly you start learning and teaching. It is an easy process that requires commitment and hard work but at the end of it all, you will realize that it was all worth it.
